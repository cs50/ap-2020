# Hello, Timberwolves! 

<div style="float: right">
    <img style="align: right" src="assets/CS_Logo_S.png">
</div>This is Computer Science Fundamentals, rougly basded on Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming for students in high school. Travis eighth grade students will receive high school credit for successful completion of this course.

The video below gives an overview of the AP version of this course taken by high school students for college credit, but roughly summarizes what we will accomplish this year. If you have siblings or friends taking AP Computer Science Principles, you'll discover the biggest difference between their course and ours will be the projects they complete during the year. If time allows, we will discuss AP-level projects so that they are not as big a shock when you get to high school.
