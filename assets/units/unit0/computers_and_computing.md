## Computers and Computing

Computers are everywhere, but it's not just desktops and laptops anymore. Now we have tablets, cell phones, watches, and so much more that perform the same functions. Consider what makes a computer a computer, thinking about the common bonds that unify all those things which we call "computers," and also perhaps start to think outside the box a bit, considering whether some devices are indeed computers, but not in the traditional sense.

- ### Thought Questions
  - What characteristics define a computer?
  - What is programming? What are some ways to "program" a machine?
  - What devices in your life are computers? Things like phones, desktops, and laptops are more likely "obviously" computers. But what about things like microwaves, dishwashers, remote controls and cars? What else?

- ### Thought Questions
  - What types of things do you compute every day?
  - When you play video games or even board games, are you computing? What sorts of things are you computing?
  - Think specifically about passive computing. What types of things might you do that don't involve you actively using a computer, but still might be considered computing.
  - Is it still considered computing if you get the wrong answer? What are the essential components of computing and computation?
